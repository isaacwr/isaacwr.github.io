		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<h3>Skybox Imaging Inc.</h3>
		<h6>Data Science Intern | Summer 2013, Summer 2014</h6>
		<p>Skybox was a small satellite imaging company in Mountain View, CA that kept everything from design and production of the satellite through to the sale of analytics in house. The first summer at Skybox, my main project was to build an automated script for color correcting sets of image tiles using open source libraries. My big project for the second summer was to build an automated workflow for extracting specific tiles from large mosaics and uploading them to an online crowd-sourcing service, and then to download and process the results of the crowd-sourcing efforts. This was interesting because it was a concrete example of turning pixels into information with one command.</p>

		<h3>Google Inc.</h3>
		<h6>Applications Operations Intern | Summer 2015</h6>
		<p>In 2014, Skybox Imaging was acquired by Google, so when I returned for a third summer internship, it was with the same people and atmosphere, but under a new name. The third summer I built a pilot delivery portal for actually delivering imagery and analytics to pilot customers. The portal involved an authentication side for creating and tracking users, as well as a delivery side where we could host imagery and analytics using Google Maps JavaScript API. This was challenging and rewarding because the company was in transition and so I was given a largely autonomous role to do something I’d never done before – build a secure website while hosting user specific data cross platform.</p>
