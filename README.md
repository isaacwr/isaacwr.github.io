###resume.html
This file contains the contents for a breif and nearly up-to-date resume for myself. Pretty straight forward.

###bio.html
Instead of writing a short bio on myself or my friend or making one up, I decided it would be more fun to write a short overview of all the people to have played James Bond over the years. This has all of the different elements of a short biography, but it's not technically a bio, but its more fun to read and write in my opinion, and it's different which is always fun.

###index.html
The homepage for my personal website, very simple implementation and links to my resume and to my 'bio' of Bond, as well as a photo of Ming.

###css/style.css
The CSS stylesheet for the entire website.
