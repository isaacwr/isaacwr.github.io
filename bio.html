	<h1>James; James Bond</h1>

	<h3>Early Years</h3>
	<p><span class=title>Dr. No</span> was the first Bond film, released in 1962 and featuring a young Sean Connery. These films were characterized by a playboyesque role for Bond where the women in the films would inevitably fall for the British spy. This pretty much set the pace for the rest of the film series, and there are arguments that no subsequent Bond character has matched Sean Connery. Mr. Connery played in 6 different films between 1962 and 1971, as well as the lead role in a non-series Bond film in 1983. All of Connery's films were box office hits, especially <span class="title">Thunderball</span> and <span class="title">Goldfinger</span>, which sit at 2 and 3 on the all time highest grossing Bond film chart. </p>

	<h3>Middle Life</h3>
	<p>After the Sean Connery era, James Bond was played once by George Lazenby (who? Exactly.) for the movie <span class=title>Her Majesty's Secret Service</span>. Mr. Lazenby remains the only actor to have played Bond only once in a series film (David Niven played Bond once in a non-series film). In 1973, Roger Moore played his first role as Bond in <span class=title>Live and Let Die</span>. Moore would go on to star in 7 total films including <span class=title>For Your Eyes Only</span> and <span class=title>Octopussy</span>, all between 1973 and 1985. This makes Moore the most prolific Bond for the series films. Timothy Dalton portrayed the British spy in two films in 1987 and '89, but he didn't leave a huge legacy.</p>

	<h3>Up Through Present Day</h3>
	<p>The next franchise actor was Pierce Brosnan. Arguably the best (and possibly my favorite), Mr. Brosnan appeared in 4 films between 1995 and 2002, most notably <span class=title>Golden Eye</span> and <span class="title">Die Another Day</span>. The Bond that Brosnan created was similar to the Sean Connery Bond of old, except more rugged and coarse, although Bond's penchant for sleeping with all of the women he met remained. In 2006, Brosnan was replaced by Daniel Craig. There were trepedations about Craig's portrayal of Bond because Mr. Craig was either too old or too old or too surley. In any case Craig has played Bond three times, with a fourth and final release expected this year. The James Bond that Mr. Craig created is the darkest yet, with much of the suave playboy vibes replaced with a more masculine and aggressive character. Notably, Craig played in <span class="title">Casino Royale</span> and <span class="title">Skyfall</span>, the latter of which is the highest grossing Bond film to date.</p>

	<h3>The Future</h3>
	<p>We know that the next James Bond will not be Daniel Craig, but it has not been confirmed who will replace him. The frontrunner at the moment is Idris Elba, famous for his role as DCI John Luther in the BBC One TV series Luther. Elba's rumoured selection as James Bond has been met with both mixed reactions. Some say it's finally time to have a black James Bond and that Elba would play the part very well, while others argue that he is much too surly and depressing to play Bond. Personally I hope he gets appointed because I think he's a fantastic actor and that we've seen so many suave skinny Bonds, it would be interesting too see a much more somber interation.</p>
